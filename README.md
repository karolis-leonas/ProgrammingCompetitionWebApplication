# ProgrammingCompetitionWebApplication

* The project was made with TypeScript/Angular 7 in the front-end and ASP.NET Core 2.2 in the backend. Project was built on template example with many of the modifications regarding design and back-end logic.
* Database was made with a T-SQL query to locally created database and it is accessed by Entity Framework mthods.
* The compiler for external code compiling was Dotnetfiddle (with base example based upon https://dotnetfiddle.net/ranOHr). Case about input parameters was not finished since I couldn't figure out how it should be executed, so only full program examples could be compiled and executed in solution field.
* Some sort of code quality control and programming practices (such as Controller-Service-Repository pattern or SOLID principles) were attempted (although it may not be 100% up to standards due to lack of polish).
* It was made in about ~9-10 hours of pure work.
